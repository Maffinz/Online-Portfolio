        <span class="my-info-text">
          <p>I like to drive around the city and take back-roads while listening to music in my car
            <br><a href="img/08vette.png">(2008 Corvette)</a>.
            <br><br>
            I like to race my car and mess around with it (At the track...legally!!). I also like to work out and mountain bike.
            Kayaking was recently added to my "fun things to do list".
            <br><br>
            I sometimes like to do software projects from scratch to practice my skills
            and try out new things.
            and as a hobby I do game development.
